## Todos

 [] Write readme for running this project
 [] Clean up code (probably don't need elementary matrix)

### Part 1

 [] Plot errors for n = 2 -> 20
 [] Summarize your findings by plotting the errors obtained as a function of n, for each of the methods.
 [] Why is it justified to use the LU or QR-factorizations as opposed of calculating an inverse matrix?
 [] What is the benefit of using LU or QR-factorizations in this way? (Your answer should consider the benefit in terms of conditioning error.)
 
### Part 2 (All)
