## Todos

 - [ ] Write readme for running this project
 - [ ] Clean up code (probably don't need elementary matrix)

### Part 1

 - [x] Code and printouts for n = 2 -> 20 :boom:
 - [ ] Plot errors for n = 2 -> 20
 - [ ] Summarize your findings by plotting the errors obtained as a function
       of n, for each of the methods.
 - [ ] Why is it justified to use the LU or QR-factorizations as opposed of
       calculating an inverse matrix?
 - [ ] What is the benefit of using LU or QR-factorizations in this way? (Your
       answer should consider the benefit in terms of conditioning error.)
 
### Part 2

 - [x] Encode x into y0 and y1 with A0 and A1
 - [ ] For the written component of this part, compare the results of the two
       methods above, and discuss the number of iterations required to obtain
       the desired precision. Is the length of the initial stream n important?
       Does n have an effect on the number of iterations required to achieve
       the error tolerance?
